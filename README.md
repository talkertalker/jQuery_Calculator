# jQuery_Calculator
An in-browser interactive calculator using CSS3, jQuery, and math.js

What I learned from this project:
・ In an application where many buttons of different logical requirements are used, planning the logic and design ahead of time greatly reduces time spent fixing errors and Googling for answers.
・ There are many great open source libraries for JavaScript, and the expression evaluation in math.js is particularly cool.

Known errors:
・ The code pushes a "NaN" value to the array currentBank if a user pushes an operations button twice in a row.
・ The "%" has yet to be implemented.
・ The application does not yet round figures that have a length greater than 8 digits.
