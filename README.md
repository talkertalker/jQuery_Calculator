# jQuery_Calculator
An in-browser interactive calculator using CSS3, jQuery, and math.js

<b>What I learned from this project:</b>

In an application where many buttons of different logical requirements are used, planning the logic and design ahead of time greatly reduces time spent fixing errors and Googling for answers.

There are many great open source libraries for JavaScript, and the expression evaluation in math.js is particularly cool.

<b>Known errors:</b>

The code pushes a "NaN" value to the array currentBank if a user pushes an operations button twice in a row.

The "%" has yet to be implemented.

The application does not yet round figures that have a length greater than 8 digits.
